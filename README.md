# CKW — Activity Tracker (Utility Platform)

CKW is a **full-stack utility platform** designed as a foundation for user-centric tools.  
The current version focuses on **authentication, profile management, and system structure**, with the goal of expanding into a complete **activity tracking and productivity utility**.

This project is being developed to strengthen full-stack development skills and scalable application design.

---

## Overview

CKW provides a basic but extensible system where users can:

- Register and log in securely  
- Maintain a personal profile  
- Access a structured platform designed for future utility features  

At this stage, CKW serves as a **core framework** rather than a feature-complete product.
